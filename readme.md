# Introduction

This little project should help the new mapper to create missions for the game "THE SETTLERS - Heritage of kings". It contains a quest
system inspired from the quest system from "THE SETTLERS - Rise of an empire". You can take the example mapscript in the projects 
subfolder "lua" and ajust it to your needs. After the work is done you simply run the build.bat or build.sh and pass your map and
your mapscript as arguments.
