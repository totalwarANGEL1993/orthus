                                                                 - In general: DO NOT USE, this can easily crash the game and requires extensive testing to get it right
                                                                 - Requires the map to be added with precedence

                                                                however most calls to engine functions will undo this. Therefore call directly before doing a calculation 
                                                                in Lua and don't call anything else until you're done.

    S5Hook.GetFontConfig(fontId)                                Returns the current font configuration (fontSize, zOffset, letterSpacing), or nil
    S5Hook.SetFontConfig(fontId, size, zOffset, spacing)        Store new configuration for this font
    Internal Filesystem: S5 uses an internal filesystem - whenever a file is needed it searches for the file in the first archive from the top, then the one below...
            | Map File (s5x)      |                             The Map File is only on top of the list during loading / savegame loading, and gets removed after            
            | extra2\bba\data.bba |                                GameCallback_OnGameStart (FirstMapAction) & Mission_OnSaveGameLoaded (OnSaveGameLoaded)
            | base\data.bba       |                             ( <= the list is longer than 3 entries, only for illustration)
            
            S5Hook.AddArchive([string filename])                Add a archive to the top of the filesystem, no argument needed to load current s5x
            S5Hook.RemoveArchive()                              Removes the top-most entry from the filesystem (only removes s5x archives, no bbas).
                                                                 - ex: S5Hook.AddArchive(); S5Hook.LoadGUI("maps/externalmap/mygui.xml"); S5Hook.RemoveArchive()
            S5Hook.GetTopArchive()                              Returns the path to the top archive (bba or s5x)

                Predicate.InSector(sectorID)
                Predicate.OfPlayer(playerID)
                Predicate.OfType(entityTypeID)
                Predicate.OfCategory(entityCategoryID)
                Predicate.OfUpgradeCategory(upgradeCategoryID)          Matches buildings of the building upgradeCategory (does not work with settler upgradeCategory)
                Predicate.NotOfPlayer0()                                Matches entities with a playerId other than 0
                Predicate.OfAnyPlayer(player1, player2, ...)            Matches entities of any of the specified players
                Predicate.OfAnyType(etyp1, etyp2, ...)                  Matches entities with any of the specified entity types
                Predicate.IsNotSoldier()                                Matches entities that are not soldiers (checked by their leader id)
                Predicate.IsSettlerOrBuilding()                         Matches entities that are settlers or buildings (filters out trees and stones and similar stuff)
                Predicate.ProvidesResource(resourceType)                Matches entities, where serfs can extract the specified resource. Use ResourceType.XXXRaw
                                                                        Notes: Use the iterator version if possible, it's usually faster for doing operations on every match.
                                                                               The Tableize version is just faster if you want to create a table and save it for later.
                                                                               Place the faster / more unlikely predicates in front for better performance!

    CNetEvents: Access to the Settlers NetEvents, where Player input is handeled.
            S5Hook.SetNetEventTrigger(func)                             Sets a Trigger function, called every time a CNetEvent is created. Parameters are (memoryAccesToObject, eventId).
            S5Hook.RemoveNetEventTrigger()                              Removes the previously set NetEventTrigger.
            PostEvent                                                   Provides access to many Entity Orders, previously unavaialble in Lua.
    
    
    Ability to trigger an attack event:
            S5Hook.EntityAttackTarget(attackerId, targetId, damage)     Executes an attack with all possible callbacks and effects (HurtEntityCallback, Trigger, kill statistics, attack marker...)
                                                                            attackerId can be invalid (0) if no attacker is present
                                                                            targetId has to be a valid attackable entity
                                                                            damage ist the raw damage done to the target, no armor or similar is applied (can be changed by S5Hook.HurtEntityTrigger_SetDamage)
    
    New HurtEntityCallback: As replacement for the LOGIC_EVENT_ENTITY_HURT_ENTITY trigger that does not get executed when the attacker is no longer valid.
            S5Hook.SetHurtEntityCallback(func)                          Sets a function to be called every time an entity hurts another entity.
                                                                            Parameters are (attackerId, targetId).
                                                                            attackerId is 0, if the attacker is already destroyed (happens only for projectile effects).
                                                                            All additional HurtEntityTrigger functions work as if in a LOGIC_EVENT_ENTITY_HURT_ENTITY trigger.
                                                                            If the attacker is valid, the LOGIC_EVENT_ENTITY_HURT_ENTITY trigger gets called after this callback.
            S5Hook.RemoveHurtEntityCallback()                           Removes the hurt entity callback.
    
    Additional HurtEntityTrigger Functions:
            S5Hook.HurtEntityTrigger_GetDamage()                        Returns the Damage that is dealt with this attack.
            S5Hook.HurtEntityTrigger_SetDamage(damage)                  Overrides the Damage this attack does.
            S5Hook.HurtEntityTrigger_GetSource()                        Returns the damage source (Technically this is the return adress).
                                                                            S5HookHurtEntitySources.MeleeAttack -> melee attack
                                                                            S5HookHurtEntitySources.ArrowProjectile -> GGL::CArrowEffect class projectile (also projectiles from GGL::CShurikenAbility)
                                                                            S5HookHurtEntitySources.CannonProjectile -> GGL::CCannonBallEffect class projectile
                                                                            S5HookHurtEntitySources.CircularAttackAbility -> GGL::CCircularAttack AoE melee attack
                                                                            S5HookHurtEntitySources.SniperAttackAbility -> GGL::CSniperAbility projectile attack
                                                                            S5HookHurtEntitySources.ScriptAttack -> S5Hook.EntityAttackTarget
    
    Global Projectile hit callback:
            S5Hook.SetGlobalProjectileHitCallback(func)                 Sets a function to be called every time a projectile effect hits its target position.
                                                                            Parameters are (effectType, startPosX, startPosY, targetPosX, targetPosY, attackerId, targetId, damage, aoeRange, effectId).
                                                                            aoeRange is -1 for GGL::CArrowEffect class projectiles and targetid is 0 for GGL::CCannonBallEffect class projectiles
                                                                            (because they are invalid/not used for this particular effect class).
                                                                            Any HurtEntityTrigger calls caused by the projectile are executed after the GlobalProjectileHitCallback.
                                                                            For Projectiles fired by S5Hook.CreateProjectile: The projectile specific callback is called first,
                                                                            the global callback will be called after that with its parameters filled from the S5Hook.CreateProjectile call.
            S5Hook.RemoveGlobalProjectileHitCallback()                  Removes the projectile hit callback.
    
    Effect created callback:
            S5Hook.SetEffectCreatedCallback(func)                       Sets a function to be called every time an effect gets created (Projectiles and normal effects).
                                                                            Parameters are (effectType, playerId, startPosX, startPosY, targetPosX, targetPosY, attackerId, targetId, damage, radius, creatorType, effectId, isHookCreated).
                                                                            For GGL::CArrowEffect class effects playerId and radius are invalid.
                                                                            For GGL::CCannonBallEffect class effects playerId and targetId are invalid.
                                                                            For all other effets only effectType, playerId, startPosX, startPosY, creatorType and effectId are valid.
                                                                            isHookCreated is 1 if this effect is a projectile created by S5Hook.CreateProjectile, 0 otherwise.
                                                                            creatorType can determine, what type of effect will be created: 7790912 -> normal effect, 7816856 -> projectile effect
                                                                            (The content of an invalid parameter is undefined (means I don't know if and for what they are good for, but someone might)).
                                                                            Do not call Logic.GetEntityDamage from the callback, this can lead to crashes!
            S5Hook.RemoveEffectCreatedCallback()                        Removes the effect created callback.
    
    S5Hook.GetAnimIdFromName(animName)                                  Returns an animation ID for use with mem funcs from an animation name (string) which can be copied from the xmls.
    
    
    S5Hook.TeleportSettler(id, px, py)                                  Teleports a settler (crashes with buildings) to a target position (by Kimichura).
    
    
    Added Lua 5.1 like bit32 functions:
            bit32.band(...)                                             Returns the bitwise and of all arguments.
            bit32.bor(...)                                              Returns the bitwise or of all arguments.
            bit32.bxor(...)                                             Returns the bitwise xor of all arguments.
            bit32.bnot(i)                                               Returns the bitwise not of an argument (Note: bit32.bnot(0)==-1 , unlike in Lua 5.1).
            bit32.lshift(i, disp)                                       Returns i shifted left by disp, vacant bits are filled by 0, disp<0 shifts right (Note: disp>=32 results in 0, because all bits are shiftet out).
            bit32.rshift(i, disp)                                       Returns i shifted right by disp, vacant bits are filled by 0, disp<0 shifts left (Note: disp>=32 results in 0, because all bits are shiftet out).
            bit32.arshift(i, disp)                                      Returns i shifted right by disp, vacant bits are filled by 0 or 1 preserving the sign, 4, disp<0 shifts left (Note: disp>=32 results in 0 or -1, because all bits are shiftet out).
            bit32.lrotate(i, disp)                                      Returns i rotated left by disp, disp<0 rotates right (Note: the result is the same if you take math.mod(disp,32) ).
            bit32.rrotate(i, disp)                                      Returns i rotated right by disp, disp<0 rotates left (Note: the result is the same if you take math.mod(disp,32) ).
            (Note alshift is the same as lshift, so there is no extra function for it).
    
    
    OnScreenInformation (OSI): 
        Draw additional info near entities into the 3D-View (like healthbar, etc).
        You have to set a trigger function, which will be responsible for drawing 
        all info EVERY frame, so try to write efficient code ;)
        
            S5Hook.OSILoadImage(string path)                            Loads a image and returns an image object

            S5Hook.OSIDrawImage(imgObj, posX, posY, sizeX, sizeY)       Draw the image on the screen. Stretching is allowed.
            
            S5Hook.OSIDrawText(text, font, posX, posY, r, g, b, a)      Draw the string on the screen. Valid values for font range from 1-10.
                                                                        The color is specified by the r,g,b,a values (0-255).
                                                                        a = 255 is maximum visibility

            myImg = S5Hook.OSILoadImage("graphics\\textures\\gui\\onscreen_emotion_good")
            myImgW, myImgH = S5Hook.OSIGetImageSize(myImg)

    Set up with InstallS5Hook(), this needs to be called again after loading a savegame.
    S5Hook only works with the newest patch version of Settlers5, 1.06 and not with the History Edition!
    S5Hook is available immediately, but check the return value, in case the player has a old patchversion.
